## 🏗️ Tech Stack Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|---------|-----------|
| **UI Framework** | Flutter | Cross-platform, MVVM-friendly |
| **State Management** | Provider | Simple, perfect for this scope |
| **Architecture** | MVVM | Separation of concerns, testability |
| **Database** | Isar | Fast, type-safe, Flutter-native |
| **DI** | GetIt | Clean, simple dependency injection |
| **Navigation** | GoRouter | Type-safe, declarative routing |

## 🚀 Next Steps (Ready to Execute)

### Option 1: Spawn Sub-Agents Now
I can immediately create **6 specialized sub-agents**:
1. **Infrastructure Agent** - Project setup, dependencies
2. **Backend Agent** - Database, repositories
3. **Domain Agent** - Use cases, business logic
4. **UI Agent** - Screens, components, design
5. **Feature Agent** - Core features implementation
6. **QA Agent** - Testing, bug fixes
7. **DevOps Agent** - Builds, CI/CD

Each agent will work on their phase in parallel where possible.

### Option 2: Start with Infrastructure First
Begin Phase 1 with a single agent, then spawn others as needed.

### Option 3: Manual Execution
You provide specific commands to run, and I execute them step by step.

## 📊 Sub-Agent Workflow

```
Main (Jarvis)
    ↓
Spawn: Infrastructure Agent
    ↓ Creates Flutter project
Spawn: Backend Agent
    ↓ Sets up Isar DB
Spawn: Domain Agent
    ↓ Creates use cases
Spawn: UI Agent
    ↓ Builds screens
Spawn: Feature Agent
    ↓ Implements features
Spawn: QA Agent
    ↓ Tests & validates
Spawn: DevOps Agent
    ↓ Deploys builds
```

## 💡 Suggested App Names

Based on the minimal, elegant nature:

1. **Notebook** - Simple, classic
2. **Noteable** - Playful, memorable
3. **Blank** - Untitled UI-inspired
4. **Paper** - Clean, tactile
5. **Jot** - Quick, action-oriented

**My recommendation:** **Noteable** ✨
- Playful on "notable"
- Short, easy to type
- Fits the minimal aesthetic

## 🎯 How to Proceed

Tell me:
1. **Which app name** you prefer (or suggest new)
2. **Start execution** — spawn sub-agents now?
3. **Start phase by phase** — manual control?
4. **Something else** — adjust plan?
